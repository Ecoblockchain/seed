		<p>An &#8220;atlas of hidden water&#8221; has been created to reveal where the world&#8217;s freshwater aquifers really lie. The hope, New Scientist reports, is that it will help pave the way to an international law to govern how water is shared around the world.</p>
<p>This prospective hydro-geopolitical legislation currently includes a draft Convention on transboundary aquifers.</p>
<p>What the <span class="caps">UNESCO</span> map reveals,&quot; New Scientist adds, is just how many aquifers cross international borders. So far, the organisation has identified 273 trans-boundary aquifers: 68 in the Americas, 38 in Africa, 155 in Eastern and Western Europe and 12 in Asia. One of these is the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System, whose waters are nearly a million years old.</p>
<p>According – somewhat oddly – to the International Atomic Energy Agency:</p>
<p>The ancient system’s massive reserves, estimated at 375,000 cu km of water (equivalent to about 500 years of Nile River discharge), are confined deep inside the earth’s underground chambers – staggered, tiered, and pooled beneath the sands of the Sahara Desert, oasis settlements, wadis (dry riverbeds that contain water only during times of heavy rain), small villages, towns, and large cities.</p>
<p>If the surface landscapes there are already so beautiful, how exciting would it be to explore those underground staggered tiers and pools&#8230;<br />
A more detailed map is due out in 2009 – meanwhile, several more can be downloaded here.</p>

		<p>There was a great article in The New York Times this weekend about an English family from Nottingham who purchased Duncraig Castle in Scotland, &quot;set on 40 acres of forested land with its own train station, boathouse and two private islands. It is a storybook maze of stone-clad turrets, square towers and steeply peaked gables set on a promontory at the edge of the woods overlooking the loch.</p>
<p>The article adds that the castle is so large – 80 rooms – that a tour takes more than an hour, and it is impossible to remember where you’ve been or where any of the rooms are in relation to one another. Indeed, the building is a warren of rooms – a design meant to help ward off drafts. In one room, you can actually squeeze behind a wardrobe and end up in the school addition.</p>
<p>As a brief aside, could you build a maze of outdoor rooms, each of them hoisted up on stilts throughout the northernmost extremes of the UK, so that they might interfere with, and thus stop, inclement weather? It&#8217;d be a design meant to help ward off drafts&quot; by trapping winds in little stop-boxes: like wind-shades, they&#8217;d help prevent certain storms from forming.</p>
<p>In other words, could you apply the internal climatic lessons of architecture – windows and doors like valves that stop drafts – to outdoor landscapes, using folly-like structures to control the weather? <br />
You stumble on strange wooden folk-constructions in the forests of Bavaria and, not knowing what they are, tear them down; fierce storms begin that very evening, and you never – literally never – figure out what&#8217;s the cause.</p>
<p>But those were anti-storm constructions, built over six hundred years ago, and the climate you&#8217;d been living in was manmade.</p>
<p>In any case, the couple who bought the castle went on to bring their entire family there with them:</p>
<p>When the family moved into Duncraig in the summer of 2003, the castle had no sewage system. Everyone used portable toilets outside the castle. Seventeen people made do with one washing machine and two kitchens. Hot water ran only to Sam and Perlin’s apartment. When winter arrived at Duncraig, which is farther north than Moscow, the days shrank to a mere six and a half hours. Without streetlights or any large town for dozens of miles, the long nights were disorientingly dark. The castle’s stone facade allowed the ever-present Highland moisture to seep right in. Without central heat, it was impossible to get warm. ‘‘We all got used to wearing damp clothes – there was no way to dry them, says Duncan Dobson. ‘‘You’d get into bed at night, and your bed was damp. All the clothes at the back of the wardrobe went rotten with mould.</p>
<p>The specifics of the ensuing breakdown make for a fascinating read, but, in broad strokes, everything falls apart: they actually pay part of the family to leave, buying out their initial share of the investment; a court order against opening a day school inside a leaky side-building full of broken electrical equipment is obtained; and the parents are, incredibly, evicted from the property without compensation. Asked why he evicted his parents, the husband simply says: I thought the family had descended into madness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, black mold that covered the plaster wall so completely it looked like wallpaper&quot; continues to grow in the unused rooms of the castle, as the couple – who still live there – sink nearly a million and a half dollars into renovations.</p>
