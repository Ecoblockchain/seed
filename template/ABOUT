This template directory mirrors the app/views directory.

Any directories and files located here will 
take precedent over those located in app/views - so you can
over-ride default rendering behaviour by putting your own
files in this directory.

To illustrate:

=VIEWS

In app/views you have the following (simplified):

app
	views
		articles
			index.html.erb	(renders list of articles for a given page)
			...
		newsitems
			index.html.erb (renders list of newsitems for a given page)
			...
		posts
			index.html.erb (renders list of blog posts for a given page)
			show.html.erb (renders a specific blog post)
			

To create a custom view for newsitems just replicate the
appropriate app/views file inside the template directory
and customise the .erb file accordingly

template
	newsitems
		index.html.erb


=LAYOUTS	

In addition to views it is also possible to template layouts. Seed
renders layouts according to rails convention using a single layout
file located at app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
		
So to customise the default layout file create your own layout at:

template
	layouts
		application.html.erb
		
For more fine-grained control you can create individual layouts for 
different resource types. Just create a layout with a name that matches
the controller that you wish to customise.

So to create a custom layout for all news pages:

template
	layouts
		newsitems.html.erb
		
Now all newsitems pages will use the layout from the templates folder 
rather than the default app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
