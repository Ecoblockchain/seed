This template directory mirrors the app/views directory.

Any directories and files located here will 
take precedent over those located in app/views - so you can
over-ride default rendering behaviour by putting your own
files in this directory.

To illustrate:

=VIEWS

In app/views you have the following (simplified):

app
	views
		articles
			index.html.erb	(renders list of articles for a given page)
			...
		newsitems
			index.html.erb (renders list of newsitems for a given page)
			...
		posts
			index.html.erb (renders list of blog posts for a given page)
			show.html.erb (renders a specific blog post)
			

To create a custom view for newsitems just replicate the
appropriate app/views file inside the template directory
and customise the .erb file accordingly

template
	newsitems
		index.html.erb
		
Seed treats the Page with an id of 1 as the home page and renders a
special view for this page within app/views/homepage/index.html.erb
So to customise the home page:

template
	homepage
		index.html.erb
		
		
==CSS

See the ABOUT file in public/stylesheets/template for information on
customising stylesheets

Some examples:

template
  stylesheets
    default.css (replaces public/stylesheets/default.css)
  
template
  stylesheets
    myapp.css (includes myapp.css after public/stylesheets/default.css)
  
template
  stylesheets
    default.css (replaces public/stylesheets/default.css)
    myapp.css (includes myapp.css after public/stylesheets/default.css)
  
In production mode all css files will be automatically combined into
a single file and cached.


=LAYOUTS

Customisation of views provides a fairy powerful way of changing
how content is rendered to suit your needs. If you need to go further
than this you can also customise layouts, (the layout files into which 
views are rendered)	

Seed renders layouts according to rails convention using a single layout
file located at app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
		
So to customise the default layout file create your own layout at:

template
	layouts
		application.html.erb
		
For more fine-grained control you can create individual layouts for 
different resource types. Just create a layout with a name that matches
the controller that you wish to customise.

So to create a custom layout for all news pages:

template
	layouts
		newsitems.html.erb
		
Now all newsitems pages will use the layout from the templates folder 
rather than the default app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
